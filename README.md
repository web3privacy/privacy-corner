# W3PN Privacy Corner

A community pop-up space as a **safe autonomous zone dedicated to privacy and cypherpunk**, suitable for complementing hackathons and other events. *Privacy Corner* is hosted and curated by [Web3Privacy Now](https://web3privacy.info/) initiative.

The concept is based on creating an open, inclusive place for meeting and discussion, like the ancient Greek [Agora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora), where anyone can come and raise any question or topic, or join the discussions. Through our [Campfire sessions](#campfire-stage) you can open discussions in a smaller circle on many topics that are not suitable for traditional talks, workshops or panel discussions.

Another feature is the [Privacy Design Clinic](#privacy-design-clinic), where through our mentors we offer help to hackers and teams to be more privacy-preserving.

## Principles
* autonomous - limited control of the main organisers
* community-based - everyone can propose a campfire
* no bullshit, marketing free
* no photos, filming or recording!

## Main components
* [Campfire Stage](#campfire-stage)
* [Privacy Design Clinic](#privacy-design-clinic) (only for hackathons)

### Campfire Stage

Everyone is able to propose their own campfire session. The only and main condition is that it must be related to our topic (eq. privacy, cypherpunk/lunarpunk). Typical length of one campfire session is 30 - 60 minutes.

W3PN will run open submissions and they will curate the entire schedule to keep the content on topic and as non-commercial and community-based as possible.

#### Examples of campfire session
* open discussion around a specific topic
* an interview with a well-known/interesting person
* introducing an open privacy tool or protocol
* networking session for privacy-curious people
* HW showcase - BananaPhone, GrapheneOS etc. :)
* author's reading from the book
* musical or visual performance

#### Requirements
* microphone, speaker, TV with HDMI input
