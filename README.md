# W3PN Privacy Corner

A community pop-up space as a **safe autonomous zone** dedicated to **privacy and cypherpunk**, suitable for complementing hackathons and other events. *Privacy Corner* is hosted and curated by [Web3Privacy Now](https://web3privacy.info/) initiative.

The concept is based on creating an open, inclusive place for meeting and discussion, like the ancient Greek [Agora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora), where anyone can come and raise any question or topic, or join the discussions. Through our [Campfire sessions](#campfire-stage) you can open discussions in a smaller circle (typically 15-20 people) on many topics that are not suitable for traditional "formal" talks, workshops or panel discussions.

Another feature is the [Privacy Design Clinic](#privacy-design-clinic), where through our mentors we offer help to hackers and teams to be more privacy-preserving.

## Principles
* autonomous - limited control of the main organisers
* community-based - everyone can propose a campfire
* no bullshit, marketing free
* no photos, filming or recording!

## Main components
* [Campfire Stage](#campfire-stage)
* [Privacy Design Clinic](#privacy-design-clinic)
* [Art Installations](#art-installations)
* [HW Showcase](#hw-showcase)

### Campfire Stage

Campfire session is one of those formats that perfectly describes what it does and what it looks like. Much like people sitting around a campfire listening to someone tell a story, a campfire session is an informal way of presenting and discussing topics with meeting attendees (["What Is a Campfire Setup & When Should You Use It?
"](https://eventleadershipinstitute.com/what-is-a-campfire-setup-when-should-you-use-it/)).

Everyone is able to propose their own campfire session. The specific form of a campfire session is very flexible and depends on the proposer. Typical length of one campfire session is 30 - 60 minutes.

W3PN will run open submissions and they will curate the entire schedule to keep the content on topic and as non-commercial and community-based as possible.

#### Examples of campfire session
* open discussion around a specific topic
* an interview with a well-known/interesting person
* introducing an open privacy tool or protocol
* networking session for privacy-curious people
* HW showcase - BananaPhone, GrapheneOS etc. :)
* author's reading from the book
* musical or visual performance

#### Requirements
* microphone, speaker, TV with HDMI input

### Privacy Design Clinic

### Art Installations

Within the space we offer the opportunity for various artists to exhibit interesting art installations related to privacy or cypherpunk themes.

## Size and placement

The size of the Privacy Corner depends on the specific conditions and event, but the base (campfire stage, desk) should be an area of about 50m2, with additional space for standing around. Art installations may require extra space.

The preferred placement is inside some larger open space where the flow of people is guaranteed.
